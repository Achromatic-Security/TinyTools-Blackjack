# Tiny Tools - blackjack.py

A very simple implementation of cmdline/terminal blackjack (aka 21).

This simple blackjack game was built during one of our famous** weekend coding challenges!*

###Usage:

python blackjack.py

#####Friday 26th Feb (PM):
- Played Blackjack and thought "Oooo.. PYTHON BLACKJACK"
- Stopped playing Blackjack and googled the rules
- Built a very basic cmd line version for dealing and shuffling (stole some code from 21cc.py)

#####Saturday 27th Feb (AM): **UPDATE**
- First commit to Github
- Worked all night
- Built a basic interface using screen
- Added dealer logic
- Added AWESOME animation
- Added some **AWESOME** ascii art (We cheated and used [this](http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Big&t=Mike%20Is%20Awesome!) awesome online ASCII art tool from Patrick Gillespie ([GitHub Profile](https://github.com/patorjk)) of patorjk.com
- Realised Blackjack is actually a little more complicated than first anticipated (split/insurance/aces high-low etc)
- Currently aces are low
- Odds pay 2-1 (Like pontoon)


*If you don't know about our coding challenges, it's basically an excuse for us to drink beer and build something cool over the course of a weekend. These are usually security related tools, however sometimes we like to mix it up. The only rule is we stop sunday night which is why some of the stuff we post looks like it has been shot into vi with a gattling gun.


We periodically revisit these things to tidy them up, especially if we need to use them as part of something larger; so it should get prettier and more OOP as time goes by.. Maybe.

As per usual. We accept no responsibility for any of the effects of using our any of our stuff, and we would like it if you credited us where possible.

Other than that.. Have fun!
